            seeking tracks for a compilation. With an immediate
            connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
            making a song. That’s when they created their
            breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good,
            funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the remix
            contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter,
            director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records,
            who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
            later, they were in his office,signing a record deal.</p>
